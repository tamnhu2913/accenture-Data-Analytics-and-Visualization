# Data Analytics and Visualization
## Introduction
At Accenture, participants work as data analysts to meet the needs of diverse clients and projects. In this job simulation, the client is Social Buzz, a platform where content takes center stage. Over the past five years, Social Buzz has grown rapidly, now reaching over 500 million active users each month. This unprecedented growth has outpaced expectations, prompting the need for advisory support to ensure a smooth scaling process. Managing this massive, unstructured data from the platform requires advanced, costly technology.

Given the scale of their data, Social Buzz has decided to bring in external expertise for the first time. There are three main reasons for this: (1) They plan to complete an IPO by the end of next year and require guidance for successful execution; (2) As a relatively small company, they lack the internal resources to handle their current scale and would rather enlist experienced professionals than hire new staff; (3) They aim to adopt best data management practices from larger corporations to deal with their vast amount of data more effectively. By seeking expert advice, Social Buzz is positioning itself to navigate its next phase of growth successfully.

To start our engagement with Social Buzz, we are running a 3 month initial project in order  to prove to them that we are the best firm to work with. They are expecting the following:  
- An audit of their big data practice
- Recommendations for a successful IPO
-  An analysis of their content categories that highlights the top 5 categories with the largest aggregate popularity

## Task 1: Project Understanding
- Meet your Accenture team, including the industry, IPO, and data experts
- Read and analyze a client project brief to understand the client and business problem, identify the requirements that need to be delivered, and identify which tasks you need to focus on as a data analyst

## Task 2:  Data Cleaning & Modeling
- Identify which datasets will be required to answer the client’s business question
- Clean the datasets and merge them to prepare the data for analysis
- Determine the answer to the client’s business question

## Task 3: Data Visualization & Storytelling
- Choose the data visualizations that best support the story you want to tell to the client
- Create a PowerPoint presentation that reports on the client’s content performance

## Task 4: Present to the Client
